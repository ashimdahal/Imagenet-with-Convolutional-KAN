# Whats this?
Write once copy again is my personal template from to train, test and save any deep learning models and projects from now on. In it's current state it can handle running on a multinode multigpu setting with appropriate multiprocessing. More multi-multi-cool things comming soon.

## todo
[] argparse inception: add argparse to hpc.sh file to be more abstract on training
[] add write once template for testing
